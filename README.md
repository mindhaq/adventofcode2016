# advent of code 2016

After somehow ~~failing with my high-staked concept for~~ not yet finishing
 last year's edition (I wanted to solve every puzzle in a different programming
language) it is time for a fresh start with this year's edition.

I will solve everything in the programming language I am most familiar with: Java.
To be more specific, in its eight iteration, and going as far as possible the
functional route, and using as little 3rd party libraries as possible, without
rewriting stuff like junit.
